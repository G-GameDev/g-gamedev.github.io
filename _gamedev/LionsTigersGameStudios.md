# Introduction
Hello lovely peoples, it’s me, back again with another little ‘god-ray’ of game development sunshine for you.

## Making games can be tough.
Most people who know anything about it wouldn't argue that point.<br>
And as you are here, reading this, on a site devoted to exactly that, 
you probably have some level of experience of exactly how hard it can be.

It doesn't matter if you are a hobbyist, or someone who is making (or wants to make) money from producing games.<br>
There are so many potential pitfalls that need to be navigated, to have any chance of getting to the promised land; 
a finished, released game.

It is therefore with regret that I need to talk about a pitfall, which isn't even directly related to the act of producing games, 
something that I feel is of importance to anyone trying to make money from their skills, 
or to operate as a business which employs such people.<br>
And then we will look at how you can reduce your exposure to this problem.

## It's not all bad...
The rest of this document can be seen to paint small, indie game studios in a bad light.
That is not my intention, and the majority are founded by well meaning, enthusiastic, 
skilled people who have a real love for the craft of making games, and the community that surrounds it.<br>
(A community I am happy to count myself amongst, and in which I have made many friends.)

# The problem
I am witnessing the increasing prevalence of ‘indie game studios’ placing adverts in almost any place they can, 
looking for people to work on games.

>What’s so wrong with that?

I hear you ask.

On the face of it, nothing.<br>
If the ads are placed in the correct places, and generally follow the appropriate guidelines then all should be fine.<br>
The problem is that many of these ads are either plain lying, making promises they can't (or don't intend to) keep, 
or are simply wasting people’s time.

Let me be clear;
I am not talking about hobbyists looking for team members.
I am not referring to projects that offer ‘RevShare’ to team members.

I am talking about people who are advertising *JOBS*, 
often in places specifically devoted to finding tech jobs (not just game development), 
and presenting themselves as being a professional organisation that has a certain degree of substance, 
when in many cases there is little to no substance whatsoever.<br>
To people who are keen to break into the industry, it is all too easy to take them at face value.

Generally speaking, the offending would-be ‘game studios’ fall into two categories:

* People who don't really understand what is actually required to produce games, hire staff, and run a business – and may not have any of the required skills to do so
* People who are intentionally trying to mislead creators into believing that they are running legitimately successful, professional businesses

Both are a problem, the second generally only to the people they interact with, the first to everyone including themselves.

# Category 1: Naiive or Inexperienced
Let us look at the first category.<br>
This is often (but in no way limited to) young and/or inexperienced people who want to be involved in the game industry in some way.
If you can't get involved because you have a useful skill-set, 
you can just set yourself up as a studio and have others do the actual work, right?<br>
There are no shortage of people who say ‘I have a game idea’, and luckily the game dev community is slowly waking up to 
the reality that more is required to consider something a viable concept than a three sentence description stating the games 
you want to rip-off and the one feature you would change which in your view makes the whole thing ‘unique’.
There are also no shortage of posts including comments such as, “I am CEO of a game studio...”

Responding in general to the vast majority of those posts:

> No. You are not.

Specifically, if they are not Yves Guillemot, Andrew Wilson, Jason Kingsley, Tim Sweeney, or someone similar, 
then they are probably just trying to make themselves sound big and important.

As a general rule, legitimate game studio CEOs are rarely if ever directly involved in spamming Discord servers with job ads, 
or trawling for talent on itch.io.<br>

> Naughty Tim Sweeney!<br>
> If I told you once I told you a million times, stop personally trawling for hobbyist game devs on my Discord server, 
> and just stick to that huge list of capable graduates literally beating down your door for a chance to work at Epic. :grin:

More specifically, being the CEO/Director/'Whatever term is used where you live', of an LLC, Ltd., or equivalent company structure, 
does NOT make them the CEO of a FUNCTIONAL GAME DEVELOPMENT STUDIO.

## But they have a registered businesses
Setting up a registered business is not the same thing as running a studio.<br>
Despite the general ideology prevalent in society today, in business just because you say you are something, doesn't automatically make it true.
What that person might be, is the CEO of a registered company that ASPIRES to be a game development studio.
What that actually means, is that they have notified their government that they might do some business activities, 
and should be taxed in a certain way on any profits they might make. That is all.

The trouble is that there is usually no actual requirement to be competent in, or even know anything about, 
either game development specifically, or operating a business in general, to register a company.

Bear in mind that various sources say 90% of start-up businesses fail, often within the first 1-2 years.

> This is all well and good…
 
you say, 

>but if these people want to waste their time and money registering companies only to file closure a short time after, 
> then let them get on with it. No?

A business undertaking a project, any business, any project, needs to be managed properly to have the 
opportunity for a successful outcome.<br>
Managing workers, cash flow/finances, resources, etc.

I don't want to get into the specifics of management here, its a useful topic for another post as far a game 
development is concerned. 
But needless to say, before you start hiring people, you need to know, as well as you can:
* Precisely what you are hiring them for
* What you will be paying them for doing it
* That you are actually ABLE TO PAY THEM whatever you promise.

This is not only sensible business practice, but it is the MORALLY CORRECT thing to do.

Putting love of what they do aside for a moment, people generally work because they need to earn money.<br>
People have financial commitments; rent or mortgages, food, even healthcare.<br>
And while the process of hiring people may feel like some kind of ‘swipe right’ power trip to those who are orchestrating it,
the hirer needs to know up front that they will be able to respect the commitments they are making.

This is more than just the promise/expectation of being paid an agreed amount at specified times.
It is the fact that to commit to something usually means turning down, or ignoring other potential opportunities.

I cant stress this point enough<br>
If you want to run your own game studio, or any other business for that matter 

DO NOT ATTEMPT TO HIRE PEOPLE UNLESS YOU CAN GUARANTEE THEM WORK AND HAVE THE MONEY UPFRONT TO PAY THEM FOR DOING IT.
{: .notice--danger}

If you cannot honestly make that statement, then at the very least be honest with people about the nature of your endeavours.<br>
Tell them you have an awesome idea and are operating on a shoestring budget, while living in your grandma’s basement, 
and working part time in a dry cleaner to make ends meet. 

## Great ideas
If you have a great idea, develop it, pursue it, make it happen.<br>
Involve others, and maybe they will love it as much as you, and even knowing the nature of the situation still want to be involved.<br>
But stop trying to present an image of things which isn't true.
>Fake it until you make it.
 
Might sound clever, cheeky, and entrepreneurial, but what you are actually doing is;

>Faking it until it all falls down around you and hurts the other people you involved.

Too many people who start down this path are only looking at their own perceived goals, 
and not the people they might hurt along the way.

So, with that out of the way, lets move on to the second category...

# Category 2: Intentional ‘Blaggers’
These are often also people who have registered businesses.<br>
Those businesses might also be registered to residential addresses, but are also often listed to a business park,
or office space rental locations.

## Looking the part
They might place big adverts in prominent places; 
professional tech job sites, message boards and the like, jostling for space next to adverts from the 
likes of EA, Rebellion, Ubisoft, etc.<br>
That association alone makes them seem somehow more ‘legitimate’.

But again, we are usually dealing with people who are not really running studios.

Remember; A company can throw up a flashy looking video, with a 'walk through' of their 'business premises', 
throwing open various doors and briefly talking about what all the people inside are involved in...<br>
All without actually having either employees or an actual business premises of their own.<br>
It is all too easy, (and often very useful for legitimate businesses), to rent business premises,
often located in very modern looking, professional surroundings.<br>
With little to no long term commitment past a couple months rent.

And sometimes there is no actual physical business.<br>
(not that it is required, but more about that later)

They might well have a website, which may even look somewhat professional.

And then there are the adverts. Lots of adverts. In every conceivable location.<br>
They MIGHT even place paid for adverts.

But again, none of this makes them a legitimate studio. 
And any potential ‘gun for hire’ with game dev related skills should be wary. 
You may find you are working for a pittance, they may even call it a ‘trial’ or ‘probationary’ period. 
They may even want you to complete certain tasks as a ‘demonstration’ of your skills. 
You may end up with little to no money from this, and they may even simply ignore your attempts to contact them. 
Then some weeks or months later you might find the ‘demonstration’ assets you worked on being sold as part of an asset pack on
one of the game dev market places. 

And there is very little you can actually do about it at that point.

>So...

you begin to ask, and I cut you off finishing your question for you:

>What can you do about these situations?

# Protect Yourself
Lets talk about that, as it is arguably the most important part of this talk.

Firstly, there are a number of red flags to look out for, when considering a ‘studio’:

* If it has no completed games in the marketplace (even free ones.)
* If it has no legitimate permanent employees who are involved full time in the day to day business.
* If it doesn't have any website, or if that website is a bit ‘sketchy’
* If it is not actively promoting its current projects, with gameplay videos, screenshots, or even concept art.<br>
There is no such thing as secrecy in game development, you might keep your source-code locked in a safe, but as soon as you have anything whatsoever worth attracting public attention, you generally do it – as publicly and often as possible.
* If it is a completely ‘virtual’ business, the address of which may well be the “CEO’s” parent’s house, and there is no verifiable proof of business trading as a studio.
* If the people running it do not seem completely transparent and open about the actual situation.
* If the contact methods offered are all anonymous; no actual phone numbers, or physical addresses, etc.
* And less specifically, if there is something about the setup which makes you feel kinda suspicious. Don’t ignore that.

## Be an Investigator!
Before you even consider responding to a job posting, do some research.<br>
Use the tools at your disposal to find out as much as you can about any outfit you see job postings for.

* Any registered company should be searchable online, and the public details will give you the names and often addresses of the people involved. 
* Follow every thread, investigate those people registered to the company; do they have any kind of ‘rep’ online, either good or bad? Are they or have they been associated with any other businesses? Do those businesses still exist? If not what happened to them? 
* Find any associated social media accounts, either of the business itself (not so useful) or the people involved (much more interesting) look at what they have been posting or have responded to on Twitter and Facebook. Do they seem like the kind of people you want to work for? Can you get an idea of their personal ‘values’ from their postings?
* In some cases you can see if these people have criminal records related to fraud or deception, or if key personnel who are NOT on the incorporation register but seem to be running the show are actually doing so because they are barred from running a company for whatever reason.
* Do they have a website for the business, and/or for specific projects? Look for dates, when was it created, how frequently is it updated? If it has its own domain, look up the registration details, who or what is it registered to, and when was it registered?
* Talk to other people; find communities where others may have had contact or interaction with this business or the people involved, and ask them what their views are.

If you get the feeling that something isn't right at any point, 
then just walk away from that job posting. Discard it. Move on.

If your research does not ring any obvious and serious alarm bells, 
then you can consider moving on to the next stage; enquiring about the job.

## Recruitment Process
Before you do that though, you need to understand something about the recruitment process 
that many candidates fail to grasp: IT IS ALWAYS A TWO WAY STREET<br>

Yes, if you think you have a chance at landing your dream job, 
it can feel all too much like being a contestant on a big TV game-show; 
suddenly plucked from the audience, and asked a bunch of questions.

But try to remember, for any job, the candidate is interviewing the business as much as the other way round.<br>
And that goes even more for situations where freelance, or remote working are involved.

Prepare a list of relevant questions before you speak to anyone.<br>
Sure, you want to know the specifics of the role and what will be required of you, but more importantly you want to know:
* How mature is their business? When was it made, what is the history? Who are the key players who formed this enterprise? A lot of this you should already have the answers to from your research, and you can compare their responses with what you already know. Don't give anything away though, don't tell them you know anything more than what would be obvious.
* Is their business solvent? What sort of financial situation are they in? Be respectful asking these kind of questions; many people will be upset by blunt and rude financial probing. So explain why you want to know these things – because you need to understand they are reasonably stable and able to honour their commitments to you should you agree to work together.
* If this is their first game, then how are they actually funding hiring people?
* What legal protections are they prepared to offer you? For example, you can insist on retaining full rights to any code/assets you create, until full payment has been received for the work. This can only go so far in protecting you, but their response to the suggestion will perhaps give you an indication of their actual intentions.

## Remote Working
For remote working, there are other things you should ask about:

* What resources are YOU expected to provide/fund yourself? Well established businesses will often provide specific hardware and software (already installed and configured) for you to use. In fact, most major companies will INSIST on you using their hardware and software for a number of reasons. They will often provide financial assistance to remote workers in terms of paying something towards their expenses such as the heating/power which is required, which they would probably pay more for if they had to put that person in an office. Small startups will probably NOT offer any of these things, and you should bear that in mind, because you are NOT working as their employee in those cases – you are a freelancer, or contractor and the laws in most countries are very different for those situations.
* Continuing from the point above, if you are instructed to sign an ‘employee contract’, that may well mean different things in different countries/regions, and come with attached legal obligations (primarily for the business, but can have tax ramifications for you.)
* The same goes for non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), they may or may not be legal or even enforceable in your particular jurisdiction.

A note about any form of contract in general:<br>
Seek legal advice from a competent legal professional, qualified and registered to give such advice in your specific country/locale.
{: note--danger }

## Electronic Contracts
Not worth the paper they are printed on.

In many cases contracts given online are not worth the time given to them.

Many small businesses and startups are looking to save money. (And rightly so.)<br>
The cost of paying for a contract lawyer is often something that they think is easily avoided,
in preference of just 'copying something off the internet', etc.
The result being that a great deal of such contracts, and non-disclosure agreements might not
even be considered valid documents in the locality in which they would need to be enforced.

For one thing it is often not even possible to prove from either side that the people who 
supposedly signed the document ever actually did so, as there were no witnesses present.

Not to mention the ease with which such things can be faked, or the details easily changed after the fact.
There *ARE* acceptable ways of doing these things, 
and secure web based methods for validating the identity of individuals and effectively ‘witnessing’ the signing of documents remotely.<br> 
But these services cost money, and generally speaking, the more ‘fly by night’ the business is, the less likely they will be to cover any costs they can get out of paying.

# Not Legal Advice
Let me say it again:
>Nothing in this document is valid legal advice -
When in doubt, seek legal advice from a competent legal professional, 
qualified and registered to give such advice in your specific country/locale.

# In Closing
So… That’s about it really.
There is certainly plenty more which could be said about this subject, 
but this should be enough to at least make people a little more aware before they enter into a potentially harmful situation.

I would very much like to know what others in the game-dev community think about this, 
don't be shy now; leave a comment on the video (or better yet, subscribe :grin:, 
or pop into the Discord server for a chat and to share your thoughts/opinions.

Good luck in all your endeavours.
