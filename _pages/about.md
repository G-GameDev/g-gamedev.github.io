# About me
I have worked in software creation for 30 years (Oh man, I *AM* old!)<br>
In that time I have created traditional desktop software, client/server systems, web applications, and cloud based solutions.<br>
I have been lucky enough to ply my trade in many different industries, in several countries.

I have managed projects with large teams, and have been fortunate to work with some talented and amazing professionals.<br>
(And some total `a##!0735`, but that comes with the territory.)

After having run several businesses, I decided it was time to stop creating software for people with money who could afford to pay for it, 
and instead do something ridiculous, and more than likely financially ruinous, and concentrate on making games.

# Why GGameDev?
Well, to many of my friends I am simply known as 'G'<br>
(Many places I have worked in the world seem to have a problem pronouncing my 'quite normal English name'. :grin: )

And this is all about game development, so... GGameDev.

# And, what's your intention with all this?
Firstly, making games (duh!)

While there are many people already who provide great resources for learning and assistance, 
I felt that perhaps there was something I myself could offer.
So this is me, throwing my hat in the ring, so to speak.
