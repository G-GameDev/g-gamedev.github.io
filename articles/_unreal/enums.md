# Enums & Bitflags
This is the supporting document for my YouTube video:

{% include video id="TuHFeS_eBe8" provider="youtube" %}

How to use enums and bitflags in Unreal game development.
We’ll take a look at exactly what these things are, how they operate, 
what they are useful for, and when to use them (or use something else.)
As usual there will be examples with both blueprints and C++ where appropriate.
