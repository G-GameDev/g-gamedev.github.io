This is the start of the GGameDev blog.
I want to use this site to tie together the game-dev work I do, with the YouTube channel, 
and provide some 'text based' reference to accompany those videos, 
and documentation for things like the plugins I create. Along with other more general
blog posts detailing things I encounter during my game-dev journey.
