This is the start of the GGameDev blog.
I want to use this site to tie together the game-dev work I do, with the YouTube channel, 
and provide some 'text based' reference to accompany those videos, 
and documentation for things like the plugins I create. Along with other more general
blog posts detailing things I encounter during my game-dev journey.

(Not everyone likes to refer to videos, some people prefer a more 'traditional' documentation approach. 
And it can be kinda helpful, as text based media if often easier to auto-translate than audio is - 
especially with MY diction. :smirk:)

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
void ADungeonFloor::OpenAllDoors()
{
	if (FloorTiles[GetAbsIdxFromRowCol(1, 2)]->DoorTop)
	{
		FloorTiles[GetAbsIdxFromRowCol(1, 2)]->DoorTop->ShowOpening();
	}

	/*for (ADungeonDoor* Door : Doors)
	{
		Door->ShowOpening();
	}*/
}

void ADungeonFloor::CloseAllDoors()
{
	for (ADungeonDoor* Door : Doors)
	{
		Door->ShowClosing();
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}
