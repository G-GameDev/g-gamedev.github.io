You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```cpp
void ADungeonFloor::OpenAllDoors()
{
	if (FloorTiles[GetAbsIdxFromRowCol(1, 2)]->DoorTop)
	{
		FloorTiles[GetAbsIdxFromRowCol(1, 2)]->DoorTop->ShowOpening();
	}

	/*for (ADungeonDoor* Door : Doors)
	{
		Door->ShowOpening();
	}*/
}

void ADungeonFloor::CloseAllDoors()
{
	for (ADungeonDoor* Door : Doors)
	{
		Door->ShowClosing();
	}
}
```
